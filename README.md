## Numerical Methods in Physics and Astrophysics

This project implements standard numerical methods such as Bisection,
Newton–Raphson, Euler, and Runge–Kutta (RK4), and applies them to
simple physical and astrophysical problems.

### Methods Implemented
- Root-finding: Bisection, Newton–Raphson
- ODE solvers: Euler, RK4

### Problems Studied
- Transcendental equations
- Free fall with air resistance
- Simple harmonic oscillator

### Key Observations
- RK4 shows significantly higher accuracy than Euler for the same step size.
- Newton–Raphson converges faster than Bisection but is sensitive to initial guesses.
