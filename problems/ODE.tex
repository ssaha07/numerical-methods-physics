PROBLEM 1 : Free fall with air resistance
        1. Physical Context

In reality, objects falling through air experience drag. This is relevant in:

Atmospheric physics

Planetary science

Space probe entry dynamics

        2. Governing Equation

Newton’s second law:

$$
m \frac{dv}{dt} = mg - kv
$$

Divide by m:
$$
\frac{dv}{dt} = g - kv
$$
        3. Analytical Solution (and its limits)

This equation can be solved analytically, but:

i. Analytical solutions are not always available for more complex drag

ii. Numerical methods generalize easily to harder cases

This allows you to compare numerical vs analytical results.

        4. Numerical Formulation

You convert the equation into the standard ODE form:

$$
\frac{dv}{dt} = f(t,v)
$$

Then apply:

i. Euler’s method

ii. RK4

Same initial condition, same step size.

What you learn: how step size affects stability and error.
